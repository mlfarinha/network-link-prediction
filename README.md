# Complex Network Science Project 2021

The project consisted in going beyond the concepts learned in the course Complex Network Science. I aimed to show that the performance of individual link
prediction algorithms is dependent of the topology of the network and that no individual predictor can be considered best or worse through its application to synthetic networks with known structure and to realworld networks. This was based on the paper *Stacking models for nearly optimal link prediction in complex networks* by Amir Ghasemian, Homa Hosseinmardi, Aram Galstyan, Edoardo M. Airoldi and Aaron Clauset (2020).
